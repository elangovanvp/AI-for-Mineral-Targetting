# AI-for-Mineral-Targetting
AI-Driven Mineral Targeting for Sustainable Mining
This project leverages geospatial data, machine learning, and terrain analysis to create a powerful mineral targeting system aimed at transforming the future of mineral exploration.

Core Contributions:
     Utilizes remote sensing and spatial data to analyze geological features with precision.
     Applies automated terrain classification to uncover hidden mineralization patterns.
     Integrates results into an interactive dashboard for real-time exploration insights.

Real-World Impact:
     Accelerates mineral discovery by reducing the need for time-consuming fieldwork.
     Minimizes environmental disruption by narrowing down exploration zones intelligently.
     Lowers operational costs for mining companies through predictive targeting.
     Supports data-driven policy-making in resource management.
     Empowers governments and stakeholders to plan sustainable extraction with minimal ecological damage.

This project bridges the gap between AI, geoscience, and sustainable development, offering a scalable solution that can be adapted for mineral exploration across the globe.
